                <p>Sir Matt Busby (1909–1994) was a legendary Scottish football player and manager, best known for transforming Manchester United into one of the world’s most iconic football clubs. As manager from 1945 to 1969 (and briefly in 1970–71), Busby built teams founded on youth, courage, and attacking football.

He created the famous “Busby Babes”, a young, talented side tragically struck by the Munich air disaster in 1958. Remarkably, Busby rebuilt the club after the tragedy and led Manchester United to victory in the European Cup in 1968, making them the first English club to win that title.

Respected for his leadership, resilience, and vision, Sir Matt Busby remains a symbol of loyalty and inspiration in world football. His legacy continues to define the spirit of Manchester United.</p>
